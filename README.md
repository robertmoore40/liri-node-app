Liri is a node.js CLI program which takes in arguments and allows the user to choose a certain function. The functions are

-spotifyThis
-movieThis
-concertThis
-doWhatItSays

SpotifyThis takes in the argument(s) and searches it, giving information about the artist, song, preview URL, and album cover

concertThis takes in the argument(s) and returns the concert venue, location, and date

movieThis takes in the argument(s) and returns Title, year, IMBD rating, country, language, plot, and actors

doWhatItSays takes in the first part of the txt file and searches the second part of it based on the first function(currently not working)
